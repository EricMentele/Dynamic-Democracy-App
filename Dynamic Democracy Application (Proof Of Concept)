Dynamic Democracy Application (Proof Of Concept)

An application that parses legislation down to the pieces that directly effect groups and individuals. This includes all legislation that is publicly available. It is stripped of legal jargon and non-essential information to be delivered to the effected.

People then like or dislike the pieces in real time to provide feedback and crowd sourced accountability checks. This would not have legal authority; although, it would lead to the social pressure of an aware and engaged populace. I believe this would influence authors of legislation towards more accurate decisions.

Technology allows us to dispel ignorance and communicate informed opinions like never before. It is time we harnessed the power of connection to dynamically organize and to decentralize understanding.
